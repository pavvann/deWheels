## About
deWheels is a decentralized peer-to-peer carpooling app that aims to reduce traffic congestion and promote a more sustainable approach to transportation, and allow the general public to find affordable rides to their destinations. The app allows drivers to share rides with passengers who are traveling in the same direction, thereby reducing the number of cars on the road. deWheels provides a secure and reliable platform for carpooling. By reducing the number of cars on the road and promoting ride-sharing, deWheels is helping to reduce carbon emissions and promote a more sustainable transportation system.

## Future Prospects
As future prospects, we aim to integrate XMTP, a decentralized messaging protocol so that drivers and riders can communicate in a decentralized manner. We also aim to integrate Lens Profiles and ENS names for less reliability on complete addresses. Apart from these, to make the process even smoother for general public, we will add email login (social login) so that users donâ€™t need web3 knowledge and wallets to use the application. A rating system will also be added so that a sense of trust can be created among the users.

## Challenges we ran into

During the development of deWheels, we faced several challenges. One of the major challenges was our unfamiliarity with frontend development. It required us to learn new frameworks and tools to build the user interface, which took time and effort. Additionally, we had to ensure that the app was secure and reliable. Another challenge we ran into was the structure of our smart contract, what way the rides should be published and booked.
